Run once:  python tracker/make_icons.py
Puts five double-click icons on your Desktop:

  Run Tracker.command      runs the SEC-filing tracker now and places its paper trades (no email; the
                           strategy sleeves only trade in the scheduled morning run)
  Plan Only.command        looks at today's plan and places NO orders
  Open Dashboard.command   opens the latest dashboard
  Capital Report.command   shows how much money each strategy is using (places NO orders)
  Strategies Plan.command  shows what the strategy sleeves would do today (places NO orders)
