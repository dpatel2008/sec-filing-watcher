auto_run.py
The hands-free daily run. The schedule (install_schedule.py) starts this a few times each
weekday morning. It checks that the market is open and IB Gateway is logged in, runs the
tracker in trade mode (paper account only), and emails you a summary.

Test it any time, with no orders placed:   python tracker/auto_run.py --plan-only
